This is why chatgpt will only return a function that needs to be called, but no parameters. However, parameters can be provided in the prompt and function calling will return the appropriate parameters.\n",

A detailed pattern recognition system/class will need to be implemented to identify all different date, address, names of people, places, countries, phone numbers or other related patterns, so that a document can be accurately turned into a template.\n",
